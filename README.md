# 🧠 Binary Classification on Imbalanced Data

This project focuses on solving a **binary classification** problem where the dataset is **extremely imbalanced**. The goal is to achieve the **best possible F1-Score** by applying various preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Thorough experimentation with **popular classification models**.
- Tackled class imbalance using techniques like **SMOTE** and **Under-Sampling**.
- Each model was trained, validated, and tested on **unseen data**.
- Added **insights and analysis** for each technique and model to better understand the outcomes.
- Clean and well-structured code suitable for educational and practical reference.
